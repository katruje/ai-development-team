# AI Development Team

An autonomous AI development team that can build software based on high-level requirements through specialized AI agents working together.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **Multi-agent System**: Specialized agents (Architect, Developer, QA) collaborating on projects
- 🏗️ **Project Analysis**: Automatic project structure and dependency analysis
- 📊 **Architecture Design**: AI-assisted system design and architecture planning
- 🔍 **Code Analysis**: Intelligent code review and quality assessment
- 🛠️ **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface
- 📦 **Modular Design**: Extensible architecture for adding new capabilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Git
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-development-team.git
   cd ai-development-team
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start the interactive CLI
python -m interfaces.cli.main start

# Show help
python -m interfaces.cli.main --help

# Work with the architect agent
python -m interfaces.cli.main architect --help
```

### Architect Agent Examples

Analyze a project:
```bash
python -m interfaces.cli.main architect analyze ./your-project --verbose
```

Show project structure:
```bash
python -m interfaces.cli.main architect structure ./your-project
```

## 🧪 Development

### Code Style

We enforce consistent code style using:
- `black` - Code formatting
- `isort` - Import sorting
- `flake8` - Linting
- `mypy` - Static type checking

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=ai_development_team --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are configured to automatically format and check your code before each commit.
